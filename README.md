Tech Audit

Thanks for the detailed overview, Raviraj! You're essentially describing a Technical Audit Management System with role-based access and workflow features. Here's a breakdown of the core components and how we can structure the project:
________________________________________
üîß Core Features & Workflow
üë§ Admin Role
1.	Configuration
o	Create Section
o	Assign Sections to one or multiple technologies
o	Upload questions for Sections
2.	Create Project
o	Define project name, description, and technologies used (e.g., React, Node.js, AWS).
o	Assign Sec
3.	Initiate Audit Cycle
o	Set audit name, start/end dates, and status (e.g., Active, Completed).
4.	Assign Auditors
o	Select auditors for each technology or section.
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Auditor Role
1.	View Assigned Audits
o	Dashboard showing audits assigned to the logged-in auditor.
2.	Start Audit
o	Load Excel file with one sheet per technology.
o	Each sheet contains questions grouped by sections/topics.
3.	Respond to Questions
o	For each question:
ÔÇß	Select: Compliant / Non-Compliant / Partially Compliant
ÔÇß	Add comments
4.	Save Progress
o	Save as Draft or Mark as Complete

üìÅ Excel File Format
Each sheet = One technology
Each row = One question
Columns:
‚Ä¢	Section
‚Ä¢	Question
‚Ä¢	Response (dropdown: Compliant/Non-Compliant/Partially-Compliant)
‚Ä¢	Comments
________________________________________
üß± Suggested Tech Stack
‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + Material UI
‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js + Express
‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
‚Ä¢	File Handling: Multer (for Excel uploads), xlsx or exceljs for parsing
‚Ä¢	Authentication: JWT-based role management
‚Ä¢	Hosting: AWS (EC2 or Amplify), or Vercel for frontend

üß† Next Steps
Would you like help with:
1.	Designing the database schema?
2.	Creating wireframes or UI mockups?
3.	Building a basic prototype or boilerplate code?
4.	Excel parsing logic for audit questions?
Let me know which part you'd like to start with, and I can guide or generate code accordingly!
